# Etch a Sketch


This is a small web project I made to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It works kind of like the old Etch-a-Sketch toy. You can draw on a grid and change colors.



## What it does

It shows a canvas and you can draw lines by moving left right up down with the keyboard keys. It also lets you draw by dragging with mouse or touch on devices that support it  
It has a clear button that erases the drawing by shaking or clicking  

## How to run it

1 Clone the repo to your computer  
2 open the Etch-a-Sketch.html file in a browser  
3 start drawing with your mouse

## Code structure

Etch-a-Sketch.html has the layout and the canvas and the erase button  
Etch-a-Sketch.css or css has the styling for the board and the button and canvas  
Etch-a-Sketch.js  has all the JavaScript for moving and drawing

## How to use it

Open Etch-a-Sketch.html in any browser  
use your mouse to draw anything you want
if you want to draw again you can refresh your browser



## New features added

- Color picker between gray, rainbow color combination and brown 
- Resize the grid to make drawing more visible
